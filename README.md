3Gapp - Enable 3G by clicking the button.
================================================

I am new at all this android development but I'm learning.

I wanted to see if its possible to control the phone with a sms message. 

This version of the app lets you set a custom pin code you can later send from any phone, 
and it will enable network data (i.e. 3G) on your phone.



WHAT ELSE NEEDS TO BE DONE
===========================

The app runs from activity right now, I need to change this to a service so it could run in background at all times.
